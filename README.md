# ChatBot

*A lab report by Ankit M. Student*

## In this Report

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I modified the chat-bot from a generic chat-bot to a home-sitter for kids/teens. This bot takes care of your kids while you are out of the house for an evening. It can get sassy sometimes!

From a technical standpoint, beyond content creation, the chat-bot utilises similar if-else conditional and input based features.


## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
